The guitar continuo in this Mutopia edition was freely
adapted from an  IMSLP edition edited by Helmut Kickton

I have kept the same layout format (re. line breaks)
as the above edition so that guitarists can easily
compare the guitar continuo with the keyboard original.

This is the first installment in what I hope will be a
Mutopia collection of pieces for flute, violin, and guitar.
Except for placing the parts files in a separate
folder, the file structure follows the Mutopia ensemble
template from https://github.com/MutopiaProject/MutopiaProject.
